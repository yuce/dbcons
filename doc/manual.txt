Introduction
------------

DB Console is a simple SQL shell for some of the databases supporting Python
DB-API 2, currently they are: SQLite, PostgreSQL and MySQL. Adding support for other
databases which has a DB-API 2 interface should be trivial, and patches that add this
functionality are highly welcome.

DB Console runs where Python runs, but it is being devolped on (Ubuntu 6.06) Linux
and also tested on MS-Windows XP; prior versions are known to work on FreeBSD
6.0.

Development platform
....................

* Ubuntu 6.06.1 (Dapper)
* Python 2.4.3
* SQLite 3.2.8 with PySQLite 2.0.5
* PostgreSQL 8.1.4 with Psycopg 1.1.21
* MySQL 5.0.22 with MySQLdb 1.2.1g3


Obtaining and Installing
------------------------

DB Console is hosted at http://dbcons.berlios.de and also Python Cheeseshop;
you can obtain it in source form.

Requirements
............

* Python 2.4 and above (Python 2.3 should also work, but not tested)
* PySQLite 2.x and SQLite 3.x for SQLite support

* MySQLdb 1.2.x and MySQL 5.x for MySQL support
