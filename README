This is just some historical code from 2006-2007 that I've rediscovered.
During that time I was learning how to program in Python.
I needed an SQLite console, but the only one available (that I came across)
was SQLite's own console which required TCL to be installed.
So I decided to write my own!

I kept all files in the "DB Console" project as is, except added this note in the README
and added `dbconsole3.py` which has the minimum changes to `dbconsole.py` to make it run on Python3.

Introduction
------------

'dbcons' is a simple console for databases supporting Python db-api 2, such as SQLite, PostgreSQL and MySQL.

DBConsole is dedicated to the nice people behind Python DBAPI-2.

Requirements:
* Python 2.4 (most probably other versions will also work).
* Sqlite 3
* PySqlite 2.x

Install
-------

- Unpack the archive to some directory,

- Make sure ``dbconsole.py`` is executable::

    $ chmod +x dbconsole.py

- Copy ``dbconsole.py`` to somewhere on the path, or create a symbolink link. On
UN*X, you could do::
    
    $ sudo ln -s `pwd`/dbconsole.py /usr/bin/dbcons

- Create a directory ``~/.dbcons`` and copy ``help.txt`` there.
